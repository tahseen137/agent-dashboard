# Mission Control 🚀

A real-time dashboard showing what your OpenClaw agent is doing, cron job health, issues requiring attention, and recent activity. Check it from anywhere — your phone, your laptop, wherever.

## Quick Start

### Tier 1 — Canvas (Zero Setup) ⚡

No external services. The agent renders the dashboard directly in your OpenClaw session.

**How to use:**
```
Show me the mission control dashboard
```

The agent will:
1. Gather current state (active tasks, crons, etc.)
2. Generate a dashboard using the canvas tool
3. Present it inline in your session

That's it. No deploy, no accounts, nothing to configure.

---

### Tier 2 — GitHub Pages + Polling (Recommended) 🌐

Free hosting with 30-second auto-refresh. Takes 2 minutes to set up.

**Setup:**

1. **Create a repo:**
   ```bash
   gh repo create mission-control --public --clone
   cd mission-control
   ```

2. **Copy the dashboard:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p data
   # Copy tier2-github.html to index.html
   # Copy assets/templates/dashboard-data.json to data/
   ```

3. **Edit `index.html`:**
   - Change `YOUR_PIN_HERE` to your chosen PIN
   - Update `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` to your GitHub username

4. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to repo Settings → Pages
   - Source: Deploy from branch `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`

5. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "Initial deploy" && git push
   ```

Your dashboard is now live at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/mission-control/`

**How the agent updates it:**

The agent runs this command to push updates:
```bash
cd ~/mission-control
# Update data/dashboard-data.json with new data
git add data/dashboard-data.json
git commit -m "Dashboard update"
git push
```

The page auto-refreshes every 30 seconds, fetching the latest JSON.

### Tier 3 — Supabase Realtime + Vercel (Premium) ⚡🔥

True websocket realtime — updates appear in under 1 second.

**Prerequisites:**
- Supabase account (free tier works)
- Vercel account (free tier works)

**Step 1: Create Supabase Table**

In your Supabase SQL Editor, run `assets/templates/setup-supabase.sql`:

```sql
-- Creates the dashboard_state table with proper RLS
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS dashboard_state (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT 'main',
    data JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE dashboard_state ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow public read (for dashboard)
CREATE POLICY "Public read" ON dashboard_state
    FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Only service role can write (push script)
CREATE POLICY "Service role write" ON dashboard_state
    FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- Enable realtime
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE dashboard_state;

-- Insert initial row
INSERT INTO dashboard_state (id, data) VALUES ('main', '{}')
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

**Step 2: Get Your Keys**

From Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API:
- Copy `SUPABASE_URL` (Project URL)
- Copy `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (anon public key — safe for client)
- Copy `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` (service_role key — keep secret!)

**Step 3: Edit the Dashboard**

In `tier3-realtime.html`:
1. Replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_URL` with your project URL
2. Replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` with your anon key
3. Replace `YOUR_PIN_HERE` with your chosen PIN

**Step 4: Deploy to Vercel**

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir mission-control && cd mission-control
# Copy tier3-realtime.html as index.html
vercel deploy --prod
```

**Step 5: Configure Push Script**

Set these environment variables on your OpenClaw machine:
```bash
export SUPABASE_URL="https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co"
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="eyJ..."  # service_role key, NOT anon
```

The agent uses `assets/push-dashboard.sh` to push updates.

## Security & Privacy

✅ **All data stays on your machine** — Nothing is sent to third parties

✅ **PIN-protected** — Simple client-side access control

✅ **No install scripts** — This is an instruction-only skill; no executable code runs on install

✅ **Credentials use env vars** — No hardcoded secrets; all sensitive values come from environment variables

### Important Security Notes

⚠️ **PIN protection is client-side only** — It prevents casual access but isn't cryptographically secure. For sensitive dashboards:
- Keep your GitHub Pages repo private and use GitHub's authentication
- Use Vercel's password protection feature (paid plan)
- Don't put highly sensitive data in the dashboard

⚠️ **Supabase service key is secret** — Never put your `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` in client-side code. The push script runs server-side on your OpenClaw machine.

⚠️ **RLS policies matter** — The provided SQL uses restrictive RLS: public can read, only service_role can write. Review and adjust if needed.

## Updating the Dashboard

### Manual Update
```
Update my mission control dashboard with:
- Action required: [your items]
- Currently working on: [current task]
```

### Automatic Updates
Set up a cron job to update every 30 minutes:
```
Create a cron that updates my mission control dashboard every 30 minutes
```

The agent will:
1. Gather current state from memory and cron status
2. Format the data as JSON
3. Push to GitHub (Tier 2) or Supabase (Tier 3)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard shows "Disconnected" (Tier 3)
- Check Supabase project is running
- Verify anon key is correct
- Ensure realtime is enabled on the table

### Data not updating (Tier 2)
- Check GitHub Pages is enabled
- Verify `data/dashboard-data.json` was pushed
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### PIN not working
- PINs are case-sensitive
- Check you're using the same PIN in both data JSON and HTML config
